# BrainWaveClassifier-MEG-ML
Thought for a second MEGInSight – A deep‑learning toolkit to decode MEG brain signals. Includes preprocessing (filtering, epoching), PCA feature reduction, and Keras-based classifiers. Benchmark suites and Jupyter examples make it easy to train, evaluate, and compare state‑of‑the‑art MEG models.
